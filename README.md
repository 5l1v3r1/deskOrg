# desktoporganizer
As the name implies, a desktop organizer that will move files into folders based on various attributes.
The functionality and GUI is minimalistic for now which I plan to fix on future releases.

I am NOT responsible for any deletions/destruction/problems it may cause, they should not appear in the first place though. Use at your own risk.

# TODO
* ~~Add releases~~
* Add option to not delete original files
* Add option to change target directory
* Add option to systematically change the name of output folders
* Add option to sort based on other attributes(name, date created, etc.)
* Option to add list of moved files along with date
* More functionality when I think of it.
